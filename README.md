Arduino powered Pong Game
For this final Programming & Electronics class, I propose to build a mini arcade machine that’s going to be the body of a recreation of the game “Pong” that’s going to be arduino powered.  
Summary
Recreating a small version of “Pong” is my way of paying tribute to one of the first arcade video games that helped establish the videogame industry and it’s very important in the complex history of Interaction Design. “Pong” was originally manufactured by Atari in 1972 and created by Allan Alcorn.  As an Interaction Designer, I want to recreate this game and also build a model for it. Using what I’ve learned in this class and using my model-making skills, this project could be a perfect combination of physical and digital components. 
Component Parts
Pieces I will buy or have already:
-Arduino Uno, Mini or Mega (input/output)
-A 0.96” Color OLED Display
-A breadboard
-Two buttons
-wires 
Parts I’m building: 
-An small arcade machine made out thin wood that I will laser cut, and paint with spray paint and by hand. 
-All the components for the “Pong” game will go on the inside of the mini arcade machine. The mini arcade machine will have windows to display the 0.96” Color OLED Display and the two buttons. 
Challenges
The project is due in 5 weeks, I’ll try my best to manage my time and not wait until the last minute to do it. 
Timeline
What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible!
Week 1: Write proposal
Week 2: buy all materials and parts I’ll use
Week 3: write the code, connect all wires, make sure everything works perfectly, test with people. 
Week 4: laser cut wood to build mini arcade model, paint model 
Week 5: Present!
